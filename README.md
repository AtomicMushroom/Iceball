The official repository is at: https://github.com/AtomicMushroom/Iceball/

We use IntelliJ IDEA 15 for development.
We recommended you to download Git as developer. 

### Soo, what is Iceball?

Iceball is minecraft-server created by me: AtomicMushroom or Thradrys (IGN).

### Better question, what is the Iceball repository? 

Basically, three very essentials plugins that are required to make you're own minigames on your own server!

## Why open-source?

Well, first off I had everything kept private, but the project was getting bigger and bigger, and is right now very hard
to maintain on your own.

## Will I get support if I use your plugins?

Nope, I'm too busy for continuous support. Feel free to ask me questions, but keep in mind, I'm not always here at my keyboard.
